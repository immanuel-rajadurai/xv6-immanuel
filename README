In this project, you’ll be changing xv6 to support a feature virtually every modern OS does:
causing an exception to occur when your program dereferences a null pointer, and adding the
ability to change the protection levels of some pages in a process’s address space.
Null-pointer Dereference (done for you)
In xv6, the VM system uses a simple two-level page table as discussed in class. As it currently
is structured, user code is loaded into the very first part of the address space. Thus, if you
dereference a null pointer, you will not see an exception (as you might expect); rather, you will
see whatever code is the first bit of code in the program that is running. Try it and see!
Thus, the first thing you might do is create a program that dereferences a null pointer. It is
simple! See if you can do it. Then run it on Linux as well as xv6, to see the difference.
Your job here will be to figure out how xv6 sets up a page table. Thus, once again, this project
is mostly about understanding the code, and not writing very much. Look at how exec() works
to better understand how address spaces get filled with code and in general initialized.
You should also look at fork(), in particular the part where the address space of the child is
created by copying the address space of the parent. What needs to change in there?
The rest of your task will be completed by looking through the code to figure out where there
are checks or assumptions made about the address space. Think about what happens when you
pass a parameter into the kernel, for example; if passing a pointer, the kernel needs to be very
careful with it, to ensure you haven’t passed it a bad pointer. How does it do this now? Does
this code need to change in order to work in your new version of xv6?
